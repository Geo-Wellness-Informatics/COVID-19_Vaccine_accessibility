# Evaluating Geographic Accessibility to COVID-19 Vaccination Across 54 Countries/Regions

## Key Findings

This comprehensive study evaluated geographic accessibility to COVID-19 vaccination sites across 54 countries/regions, revealing significant disparities in vaccine access:

- **Major disparities in accessibility**: In about 24% of studied countries/regions, over 95% of the population can access vaccination services within 15 minutes. However, in places like Manitoba (Canada), Zimbabwe, and Bhutan, less than 30% of the population can reach sites within 60 minutes.

- **"Vaccine deserts"**: Underserved areas were identified in both high-income countries (HICs) and low and middle-income countries (LMICs).

- **Correlation with outcomes**: Countries with higher vaccine accessibility tend to achieve higher vaccination rates, while those with lower accessibility often experienced higher COVID-19 mortality increases.

- **Economic factors**: A significant positive relationship was found between GDP per capita and vaccine accessibility (Î²=0.323, p<0.001).

## Methodology

The researchers used four key measures to evaluate vaccine accessibility:
1. Population coverage with varying travel time thresholds
2. Driving time patterns to vaccination sites
3. Number of sites available within a 30-minute threshold
4. Geographic accessibility index using enhanced two-step floating catchment area method

Data was collected at 1km resolution, with geocoded vaccination sites and population data from WorldPop.

## Implications

- LMICs require enhanced attention to improve geographic accessibility to vaccination
- Internal disparities exist within both HICs and LMICs
- National public health officials should prioritize "vaccine deserts" 
- More equitable vaccine access planning is crucial for future pandemics
