# Evaluating Geographic Accessibility to COVID-19 Vaccination Across 54 Countries/Regions

## 📊 Overview

Our study published in [BMJ Global Health](https://gh.bmj.com/content/10/2/e017761) investigates COVID-19 vaccination accessibility across 54 countries/regions worldwide. This collaborative research between the University of Hong Kong, UCL, University of Glasgow, and Kyung Hee University offers unprecedented insights into global vaccine distribution patterns.

## 🔬 Methodology

We developed an innovative framework analyzing population data and vaccination site locations at 1-km resolution. Using multiple metrics, we evaluated vaccine accessibility:

- 🚗 Travel time to nearest vaccination sites
- 👥 Population coverage within varying time thresholds
- 🏥 Number of sites within 30-minute travel radius
- 📈 Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA) accessibility index

## 🌍 Key Findings

### Global Disparities
- In 24% of studied regions, over 95% of population could reach vaccination sites within 15 minutes
- In Manitoba (Canada), Zimbabwe, and Bhutan, over 70% of residents faced travel times exceeding one hour
- Hong Kong SAR had the highest number of accessible sites (319), while Manitoba had the lowest (0.04)

### Economic Factors
- Significant positive relationship between GDP per capita and vaccine accessibility (β=0.323, p<0.001)
- Notable exceptions: Luxembourg showed limited accessibility despite high GDP; New Brunswick achieved excellent accessibility despite lower GDP

### Health Outcomes
- Countries with better vaccine accessibility generally achieved higher vaccination rates (β=0.139, p<0.01)
- UAE and Singapore maintained high vaccination rates despite moderate accessibility
- No significant relationship found between vaccine accessibility and COVID-19 mortality increases

## 🔍 Implications for Future Pandemic Preparedness

- Enhanced international cooperation is essential for equitable vaccine distribution
- Strategic investment in health infrastructure and mobile clinics in areas with low accessibility
- Development of refined public health strategies addressing internal disparities within countries
